This is the source for my personal website https://danielturcich.com/ built with Angular 5 and Material 2

Website is being hosted with Firebase due to ease of use, NPM command line support, and reliablity/ speed. Domain obtained through Namecheap.com.

This project was created by cloning https://github.com/m67hoff/material2-sample to have a quickstart to build off of.
